In Java, unit tests are created with JUnit.
tagTarget.caption.header.ria =  RIA - Rich Internet Application
tagTarget.caption.body.ria = Applications in the www or intranet that deliver a user interface and scope of interactions \
that are typical for classical desktop programs (e.g. <a href="tags.action?tag=effects">effects</a>, animations, various media implementations, drag&drop, advanced input events). \
Part of the realization are asynchronous requests via AJAX.
tagTarget.caption.header.effects =  Effects
tagTarget.caption.body.effects = On a website or user interface, effects are the enhancement of an element`s visual appearance in order to \
support <a href="tags.action?tag=ux">UX</a>, guide the user`s attention or simply contribute to the look and feel. They should always serve a practical purpose instead of hindering usability. \

tagTarget.caption.header.social = Social Media - digital networking
tagTarget.caption.body.social = A key feature of the Web 2.0 is the social exchange via user generated content in digital media. \
The WorldWideWeb delivers a platform for social networks through individual spreading of news, blogs, comments and media formats.\
Links to accounts on well-known social media portals from homepages allow an integration into established network structures.
tagTarget.caption.header.oop = OOP - object oriented programming
tagTarget.caption.body.oop = In order to handle real life problems most efficiently, modern programming employs objects that reflect all relevant \
properties of their real equivalents. In this way, object oriented programming allows a much more efficient and realistic approach, \
compared to procedural programming. Further advantages of OOP amongst others are inheritance (resulting in reusability and extensibility), \
encapsulation, cohesion and lose coupling (resulting in good changeability and maintainability).
tagTarget.caption.header.tag-cloud = Tag-Cloud - a headword compilation
tagTarget.caption.body.tag-cloud = A Tag-Cloud is a means of information visualization, where a collection of linked key words \
is loosely placed in an area of a web page. For emphasizing or styling purposes, single words can be displayed larger, \
or with a different font size/color. A tag-cloud`s words are typically linked to corresponding content for further reading.
tagTarget.caption.header.i18n = i18n - Internationalization
tagTarget.caption.body.i18n = The strict separation of structure, design, behaviour and content makes it possible to provide texts \
in various versions, mainly to offer a choice of languages. This way, an arbitrary number of language dependant properties-files can coexist \
that can be displayed according to the user agent`s information or the user`s manual input.
tagTarget.caption.header.quality = Software Quality - determining a software`s excellence
tagTarget.caption.body.quality = An application`s value is affected by criteria such as functionality, usability, reliability, efficiency, \
maintainability and portability/extensibility. It`s about making a unit`s properties meet all specified requirements and qualifications.

tagTarget.caption.header.jquery = jQuery - a JavaScript library
tagTarget.caption.body.jquery = Amongst the great number of JavaScript libraries, jQuery has gained the greatest popularity. \
JQuery makes DOM manipulation simple, compared to using pure JavaScript. Further advantages are sophisticated <a href="tags.action?tag=cross-browser">cross browser compatibility</a>, \
reliable <a href="tags.action?tag=effects">effect</a> and <a href="tags.action?tag=animations">animation handling</a> as well as \
universal implementation of asynchronous server requests (<a href="tags.action?tag=ajax">AJAX</a>).
tagTarget.caption.header.svg = SVG - scalable vector graphics
tagTarget.caption.body.svg = As opposed to pixel images, scalable vector graphics are based on mathematical equations describing the displayed geometry. \
In addition to the loss-free scaling of SVG pictures, this also allows for their manipulation, e.g. for the implementation of effects and animations. \
An SVG´s properties are all included in markup that can be easily embedded into an Html document.
